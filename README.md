# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## Getting a little deeper into Javascript & CSS!

I stumbled upon this really great video on youtube which walked through how to build a game of rock paper scissors and apply some great CSS styles. 

There is definitely an abundance of tutorials out there that take you through how to build a rock paper scissors game. However, this one caught my attention as there was actually a lot of time spent on setting up CSS styles and making sure it not only functioned - but it looked good too!
