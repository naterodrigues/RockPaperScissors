# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## Getting a little deeper into Javascript & CSS!

I stumbled upon this really great video on youtube which walked through how to build a game of rock paper scissors and apply some great CSS styles. 

There is definitely an abundance of tutorials out there that take you through how to build a rock paper scissors game. However, this one caught my attention as there was actually a lot of time spent on setting up CSS styles and making sure it not only functioned - but it looked good too! 

| Programming Language | What I delved into | 
|:-:|:--|
|CSS|<ul><li>Importing google fonts and setting a backup.</li><li>Box shadows, creating circles and displaying divs in-line</li><li>Getting familiar with margins, paddings and using text-transform</li><li>Changing the cursor on hover on objects</li></ul>|
|Javascript|<ul><li>Understanding difference of declaring variables using Let vs Var vs Const</li><li>Caching DOM variables to optimise performance and cleaner code</li><li>Practice with creating multiple functions, switch statements, use of Math.</li><li>Converting ES5 code into ES6 for e.g. using `() =>` to replace `function()` and using back ticks to avoid having to string together multiple strings and functions without using the '+' sign</li><li> </ul>|
